# Blazor Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This project is to practice the use of Blazor, WebAssembly, and C# by developing a sorting algorithm visualizer. The application demonstrates various sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations, allowing users to see how different algorithms sort data in real-time.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- **Learn and Practice Blazor**: Gain hands-on experience with Blazor and WebAssembly by building a functional web application.
- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**: Create a dynamic and interactive visualization to understand how different sorting algorithms work.
- **Improve C# Skills**: Enhance proficiency in C# by implementing algorithmic logic and UI components in a Blazor environment.

## Features

- **Canvas**: A canvas element to draw and visualize sorting processes.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implement and compare various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, BOGO Sort).
- **Real-Time Updates**: See live updates as the sorting algorithms process data.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parameters like array size and sorting speed for better experimentation and understanding.
